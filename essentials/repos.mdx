Connect your codebase to [cto.new](http://cto.new) by linking repositories from either GitHub or GitLab.

## Task Runner Setup

Make sure to configure the task runner environment for each connected repo. This is the virtual environment where the agent works on your code. 

You can run system setup steps, install project dependencies, and define code checks steps. This allows [cto.new](http://cto.new) to do things like build, run, test, lint, and format your code.

<Note>
  Try the setup agent which can configure most of this for you
</Note>

Once you have completed setup, run a test so that you know everything works as it should. If you used the setup agent it will do this for you.

## Default Model

You can set the default code agent model for each repo in repository settings. 

You'll find lots of other settings available here too. Learn more about these in settings and config.
