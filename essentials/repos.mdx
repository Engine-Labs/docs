Connect your codebase to [cto.new](http://cto.new) by linking repositories from either GitHub or GitLab.

Make sure to configure the task runner environment for each connected repo. This is the virtual environment where the agent works on your code. 

You can run system setup steps, install project dependencies, and define code checks steps. This allows [cto.new](http://cto.new) to do things like build, run, test, lint, and format your code.

<Note>
  Try the setup agent which can configure most of this for you
