Engine will usually do its best to complete a task but it may not be what you had in mind. Here are a few things you can do to make sure you and Engine are on the same page.

### <Icon icon="calendar-lines-pen" /> **Keep it short and to the point**

Try to exclude irrelevant context. Pasting in long AI generated task descriptions often doesn't help.

### <Icon icon="arrow-down-left" /> **Be specific**

If there are specific files or pieces of code you want to edit, mentioned them\! If there's a data source you want to work with, add that too.

If similar patterns or templates exist for a given task, it can help to refer to them.

### <Icon icon="file-waveform" /> **Tests?**

Let Engine know what you testing requirements are for a particular task, or any other success criteria you have.

### <Icon icon="question" /> **Avoid vague tasks**

Engine will attempt to complete vague or poorly defined tasks, but the outcome is unlikely to be what you had in mind.
