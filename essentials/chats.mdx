Start a chat with [cto.new](http://cto.new). It has context across your whole codebase, tools and connected MCPS.

[cto.new](http://cto.new) chat can help you figure out what to work on, plan tasks, and write code.

<Check>
  Chat sessions are private to each user.
</Check>

MCPs that you add in the chat interface are scoped to the chat only. Plan and code agents wont't be able to use them. To add MCPs that plan and code agents can use, add your MCP in the relevant repository settings tab.

<Note>
  Try asking [cto.new](http://cto.new) what you should work on
</Note>

## Plan and Code agents

[cto.new](http://cto.new) creates planning and coding agents (tasks) from a chat session so you can keep chatting while they work. You can see all running agents from inside a chat by opening the agent sidebar.

Since [cto.new](http://cto.new) can spin up coding agents which work on tasks, there's a handy pane to see all tasks directly from the chat interface. You can also see all running tasks from the normal tasks page.

## Draft Tasks

Drafts are tasks that [cto.new](http://cto.new) thinks could be important. These tasks will be suggested on the app homepage or at the right moment during a chat session You can also see all draft tasks by opening the draft tasks pane in a chat session.
