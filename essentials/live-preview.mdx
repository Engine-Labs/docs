Live preview is a vibe coding interface in [cto.new](http://cto.new) that lets you instantly preview running apps and task changes for compatible repos.

<Note>
  You can create a new live preview compatible project from the live preview page
</Note>

You can select a repo to preview and work on from the live preview page. If you haven't used live preview in a while, initial startup may take a few minutes.

To set up a repo for live preview, make sure it has build and run steps in the [task runner config](https://docs.cto.new/settings-config/vm). You can run the [setup agent](https://docs.cto.new/settings-config/setup-agent) to help write these commands.

<Warning>
  Only compatible apps that have been properly configured work with live preview.
