1. Stick to default models unless you are tinkering. Claude 3.5 and 3.7 are consistently the most reliable.
2. Make sure you have as many set up, dependency and code check steps as possible set up in your Engine VM for each repo and that the VM test is passing. This means that it is sure to pass your checks once a merge request is made. It looks like most of your repos are set up pretty well now\!
3. Give Engine well defined tasks you might give to a junior/mid level engineer as defined and expect a good outcome. This typically maps to the bottom 50% of issues on a typical well-managed board in terms of complexity.
4. If a task seems to be going off script, you want to try different models/settings, or you have updated the issue it's usually best to kill the task and start again. You can do this by closing the MR, archiving the task and re-adding the label in Linear. Engine's MRs should be seen as quite disposable and a good success rate is around 70%.
