Give Engine well defined tasks you might usually ask a junior or a mid level engineer to complete. This usually maps to the bottom 50% of issues in terms of complexity on a typical well-managed board.

The more tightly defined a task is, the better Engine will perform. To get Engine to help with bigger tasks, try splitting them into smaller, well defined issues - this also helps with code review\!

Examples of tasks Engine is a great fit for:

- Simple bug fixes
- UI updates
- New API endpoints
- Minor refactoring
- Adding specific unit tests

Put Engine to work on all those backlog issues that never get done\!
