Engine requires an integration to a version control provider to push commits and make PRs.

<Warning>
  We **strongly** recommend that you add branch protection rules whenever you allow AI to access to your codebase.
</Warning>

You can link Github easily by selecting 'connect code' from the sidebar in the Engine app and following the authentication flow.

### Using Engine in Github

Engine can continue work on PRs it has already been assigned or start work on new PRs. There are several ways to interact with Engine from Github.

**Existing tasks**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code review" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Review an Engine PR to have Engine pick it back up and make changes.

    You can make line-by-line comments or just leave a high level review. It's best to 'request changes' to make it clear you need Engine to re-start work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
    Tag @engine-labs anywhere in the PR to get engine to restart work on a task.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**New PRs**

<Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
  Tag @engine-labs anywhere in the PR to get engine to restart work on a task.
</Accordion>

Closing or merging a PR in Github will update its status in Engine.

### **Permissions**

You can restrict Engine's access to particular repos if you like. You can update this later in your Github application settings.

<Note>
  The user linking Engine to Github must have sufficient permissions to create webhooks on all the repos you want Enigine to work on.
