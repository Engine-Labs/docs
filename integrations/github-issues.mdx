Engine can serve as an AI software engineering agent for your Github issues.

Engine receives all context from a Github issue, including images.

### **Set up your Github Issues integration**

The Github issues integration is available for users who have already connected Engine with Github.

Select Github issues on the integrations page after you have linked your Github account.

### **Starting a task**

There are a couple of ways to start a task from your Github issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Label Engine" icon="tag">
    Add the Engine repo-specific label to an issue and Engine will automatically start work. You can find labels for each repo on the repositories page in Engine. It will typically be engine-[your_repo_name].

    Engine will comment in the issue when it has finished working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
    You can tag @engine-labs in a comment and Engine will pick it up or restart work if it's an existing task. If its a new task, Engine will figure out which repo to work on and get started.
  </Accordion>
