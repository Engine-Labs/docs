### **Set up your Linear integration**

After logging in to your account and setting up your organisation, select 'Connect tickets' from the sidebar. Then, select Linear from the pop-up modal.

Follow the authorisation flow to complete the connection. If you have signed in with Linear, this step is already complete.

### **Linking a team**

Once you have linked Linear to Engine, you'll need to link a team to a repo so Engine knows where to look for tasks you assign.

You can do this from the repo menu where you will see a button on the repo to link a team.

### **Starting a task**

There are a few ways to start a task from Linear:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Label Engine" icon="tag">
    Add the Engine repo-specific label to an issue and Engine will automatically start work. You can find labels for each repo on the repositories page in Engine. It will typically be engine-[your_repo_name].

    Engine will comment in the issue when it has finished working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@engine" icon="at">
    You can tag @engine in a comment and Engine will pick it up or restart work if it's an existing task. If its a new task, Engine will figure out which repo to work on and get started.

    Engine will react with an emoji so you know it has recognised your comment.

    Commenting @engine help in an issue will let you know how to interact with Engine.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign an issue to engine" icon="person-circle-plus">
    Assign an issue to engine. Engine will figure out which repo to work on and get started.
