### **Set up your Linear integration**

After logging in to your account and setting up your organisation, select 'Connect tickets' from the sidebar. Then, select Linear from the pop-up modal.

Follow the authorisation flow to complete the connection.

### **Linking a team**

Once you have linked Linear to Engine, you'll need to link a team to a repo so Engine knows where to look for tasks you assign.

You can do this from the repo menu where you will see a button on the repo to link a team.

### **Starting a task**

There are two ways to start a task from Linear:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tag Engine" icon="tag">
    Tag Engine in an issue and Engine will automatically start work. You can find repo specific labels on the repositories page in Engine. It will typically be engine-[your_repo_name].

    Engine will comment in the issue when it has finished working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
    You can tag @engine-labs in an issue and Engine will pick it up task or restart work if it's an existing task.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Engine support for the Linear agents API is coming soon
