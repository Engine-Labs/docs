Add any MCP server to Engine's tool set to use while it works on your tasks.

You can add local or remote MCP servers to each repo individually. You can do this from the repositories page in the Engine app.

A few examples:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp)
- [Mem0](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/mcp-server)
