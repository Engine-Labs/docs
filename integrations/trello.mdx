### **Set up your Trello integration**

After logging in to your account and setting up your organisation, select 'Connect tickets' from the sidebar. Then, select Trello from the pop-up modal.

Follow the authorisation flow to complete the connection.

### **Linking a team**

Once you have linked Linear to Engine, you'll need to link a board to a repo so Engine knows where to look for tasks you assign.

You can do this from the repo menu where you will see a button on the repo to link a board.

### **Starting a task**

Tag Engine in a card and Engine will automatically start work. You can find repo specific labels on the repositories page in Engine. It will typically be engine-[your_repo_name].

Engine will comment in the card when it has finished working.
