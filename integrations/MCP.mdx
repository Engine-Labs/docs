MCPs allow [cto.new](http://cto.new) to gather context and take action across a wide range of tools and services. You can interact with them from the [cto.new](http://cto.new) chat.

MCPs can be added from the chat sidebar.

<Note>
  MCPs added to the chat are not available in coding or planning agent sessions

## Custom MCPs

You can also add any custom local or ramote MCP servers to the task runner's tool set. These MCPs will be availble to planning and coding agent sessions. Find this in your repository settings page.
