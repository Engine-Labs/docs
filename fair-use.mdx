We offer unlimited AI usage completely for free, for the most people that we can.

Our fair use allowance helps us avoid platform abuse and empower users who are building effectively with [cto.new](http://cto.new).

Your mileage may vary depending on real time demands on our systems, capacity limits at any given time, and individual patterns of usage.

If you use up your fair use allowance, it usually resets by the following day.

<Warning>
  Enabling auto model routing typically increases your effective allowance by at least 5x!
</Warning>

Hints to maximise your free use allowance:

- Assign well defined tasks and review the results
- Use task appropriate models. Auto model router does this for you!
- Make sure everything is set up properly. In particular, check your task runner is configured
- Use [cto.new](http://cto.new) as part of a professional workflow

<Note>
  If you switch to premium, you will get immediate access to dedicated monthly capacity.
