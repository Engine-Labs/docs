  <Accordion title="Engine isn't responding to labelled tasks">
    Sometimes this is resolved by unlinking and reconnecting your workflow app. Double check for correct permissions during the auth flow.

    When a task is very large - several large images or text many thousands of characters in length - Engine will not be able to process it due to hard limits on its infrastructure. You can work around this limitation by splitting up tasks into smaller tickets and trying again.

  <Accordion title="I don't see my repo in the connect repo menu">
    Make sure you have allowed Engine access to the repo you are trying to worth with. You can change Engine's permissions from the Engine application settings page in in your git providers application.

    You also must have permissions to create webhooks on any repo you want Engine to work on.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My Github or Gitlab connection wasn't successful">
    Uninstall the Engine app from Github or Gitlab and then retry connecting from Engine.
