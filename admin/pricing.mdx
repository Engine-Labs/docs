Engine costs cedits per task run - credit usage varies depending on which model you use. Each plan includes a certain number of credits. 

A task run is a job you assign to Engine from an external integration or from the Engine app.

Typically, one task results in one pull request.

A task includes free revisions, whether from a code review, a trigger from the Engine app, or a tagged comment.

<Warning>
  Some models may cost more than one 'task' per assigned job. This is detailed during model selection in the app.
