  <Accordion title="Configure the task runner" icon="washing-machine" iconType="regular">
    Setting up the task runner is optional, but it will certainly improve results. It helps cto.new understand how to run and check your code.

    This helps cto.new write code that passes any pre-commit checks and pipeline steps, and ensures the code does what you expect.

  <Accordion title="Review cto.new's code" icon="face-monocle">
    We recommend that you review cto.new's code before merging it. This not only helps ensure it is correct, but keeps you in the loop on your own codebase.

    This step can be faster if you have test suites, lint checks, etc.

    It's easiest to stay on top of cto.new's work by reviewing  PRs soon after they are made. This avoids code review piling up or PRs becoming outdated as your workflow speeds up.

## Prompting tips

cto.new will usually do its best to complete a task but it may not be what you had in mind. Here are a few things you can do to make sure you're both on the same page.

### <Icon icon="calendar-lines-pen" size={23} /> **Keep it short and to the point**

Try to exclude irrelevant context. Pasting in long AI generated task descriptions often doesn't help.

### <Icon icon="arrow-down-left" size={23} /> **Be specific**

If there are specific files or pieces of code you want to edit, mention them! If there's a data source you want to work with, add that too.

If similar patterns or templates exist for a given task, it can help to refer to them.

### <Icon icon="file-waveform" size={23} /> **Tests?**

Let Engine know what you testing requirements are for a particular task, or any other success criteria you have.

### <Icon icon="question" size={23} /> **Avoid vague tasks**

Engine will attempt to complete vague or poorly defined tasks, but the outcome is unlikely to be what you had in mind.
