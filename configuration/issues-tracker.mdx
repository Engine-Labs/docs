### **Autopilot**

Autopilot enables Engine to automatically pick up and attempt tickets and issues from your workflow tool once a day.

<Info>
  Autopilot is only available on select Engine plans.
</Info>

You can enable autopilot from the workflow integration page in the Engine app.

Autopilot can be set to plan mode or task mode:

- **Plan mode** - Engine will automatically create a plan inside the ticket for your approval. Relabel the ticket with the Engine tag to get Engine to start writing code.
- **Task mode** - Engine will automatically start work in a new branch on your repo. React to Engine's comment with a emoji and Engine will open a PR.

### **Plan mode**

Individual repos can be set to plan mode.

Plan mode adds a comment to the issue describing Engine's planned implementation and any clarifying questions.

To get Engine to start on implementation, relabel the issue with the Engine tag.
