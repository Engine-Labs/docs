Engine's system prompt is automatically optimised for each repo you connect as soon as you connect it.

You can re-run prompt optimisation from the prompt settings page. You might like to do this if, for example, you make substantial changes to your repo outside of Engine.

You can manually update Engine's sytem prompt if you like. This can help if you add MCP servers or have specific requirements of Engine for every task you assign.
