These settings are applied across repos and workflows.

### Branch naming

You can configure the branch naming template.

cto.new provides several common variables you can include using handlebar notation.

### **Pull request configuration**

Configure how cto.new opens PRs, including commit message, title, and description by defining rules in natural language.

### Change Git Committer

By default, cto.new will commit as `engine-labs-app[bot]` but you can change this from the git provider settings menu.

### Ignore git users

You can ignore git users (such as bots) meaning triggers from these users will not start new tasks.
