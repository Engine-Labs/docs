### System Prompt

The system prompt is automatically optimised for each repo.

You can re-run prompt optimisation from the prompt settings page. You might like to do this if, for example, you make substantial changes to your repo outside of cto.new.

You can manually update the system prompt. This can help if you add MCP servers or have specific requirements of cto.new for every task you assign.

### Memory

cto.new has long term memory for each repo it works on. This is added to the model's context alongside the system prompt for each task.

Memory is automatically maintained as you go. You can also edit it yourself.

The code writing agent decides to save bits of advice or guidance from comments in tickets and code reviews or as the agent works and learns about the codebase.
