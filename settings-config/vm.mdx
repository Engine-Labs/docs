cto.new works in a firecracker instance in the cloud. It is a virtual machine that we call a **'task runner'**.

Properly configuring the task runner with system setup, project dependencies, and code checks will significantly improve the agent's work.

<Check>
  cto.new can attempt to configure its own task runner using the setup agent
</Check>

cto.new will automatically resize your VM's memory to meet the needs of your project in increments of 2Gb from 4Gb to a maximum of 16Gb. Users that require more than 16Gb of memory should [contact us](/admin/support).

### System Setup

Install and configure software, tools, and packages required at the system level.

For example, this system setup configration installs Node 18 and configures a database to run tests:

```[expandable]
# Downgrade to Node v18
sudo apt-get remove -y nodejs && curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Create test database
export PGPASSWORD=postgres && psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE test_db;"

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate
```

Every Engine VM has the following base system specification by deault.

</Accordion>

### Project Dependencies

Install repo specific dependencies like libraries, frameworks and packages.

For example, use npm to install project dependencies:

```[expandable]
# Install deps
npm install
```

### Code Checks

Code checks are commands Engine runs before committing your code, to ensure it passes and pre commit or pipeline steps.

Use code checks to lint, test and build your code, for example:

```[expandable]
# Run lint
npm run lint

# Run build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Git Actions Workflow (beta)

If you have any actions workflows in your git provider you can select them from the dropdown menu to be included in Engine's code checks.

Any selected actions will appear as an additional step in the code checks section.

---

- 

Run a test to verify your task runner is confured properly and Engine can successfuly make commits.

<Note>
  You task runner setup won't be used by Engine unless it has been tested successfully
</Note>

Running a test can take several minutes but can be manually stopped.

If your pipeline changes or you make any changes to Engine's VM you must re-run the tests to ensure Engine can work effectively.

### Task Runner Terminal

You can open a terminal on an instance of Engine's task runner to test any command or series of commands.

This can be helpful in debugging Engine's VM configuration.

You can access the terminal from the VM setup page for a given repo.

<Warning>
  Any commands entered in the terminal will not persist to any other instances of Engine's VM.

  The system available in the terminal will always start with the default VM specification.
