There are configuration options that can be set on a per repo basis.

### Default model

You can set the default model for planning and coding for each repo. This will be overriden if you explicitly choose a model for a particular task.

### Plan mode

Individual repos can be set to plan mode.

Plan mode adds a comment to the issue describing Engine's planned implementation and any clarifying questions.

To get Engine to start on implementation, relabel the issue with the Engine tag or tag @engine-labs in a comment.

### Setting the Base Branch

You can set the base branch for Engine to work off for each repository in the repository settings page.
