There are configuration options that can be set on a per repo basis.

### Default model

You can set the default model for planning and coding for each repo. This will be overriden if you explicitly choose a model for a particular task.

### Plan mode

Individual repos can be set to plan mode.

Plan mode adds a comment to the issue describing cto.new's planned implementation and any clarifying questions before writing any code.

### Setting the Base Branch

You can set the base branch for cto.new to work off for each repository in the repository settings page.
