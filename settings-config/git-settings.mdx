### Branch naming

You can configure Engine's branch naming conventions from the git provider settings menu.

Engine provides several common variables you can include using handlebars

### Changing Git Committer

By default, Engine will commit as `engine-labs-app[bot]` but you can change this from the git provider settings menu.

### Setting the Base Branch

You can set the base branch for Engine to work off for each repository in the repository settings page.

### Ignoring git users

You can ignore git users (such as bots) from the git menu in the Engine app. This will exclude  events from these user triggering automatic triggers.

### Automatic Triggers

<Note>
  Automatic triggers will only work if your repo has a passing [VM setup](/dev-env/vm)
</Note>

If Engine is properly setup for your repo, it will automatically respond to a failing pipeline or automatic reviews and attempt to work on your PR until is in a passing state. Typically, Engine will try to do this three times.
