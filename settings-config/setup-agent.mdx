Using the setup Agent, cto.new can attempt to automatically configure and test its development environment for your repo.

The setup agent will run automatically when a new repo is connected and can be re-run from the repositories VM settings page.

<Warning>
  You may be required to edit the task runner setup!
</Warning>

This can take several minutes depending on the size and complexity of your repo and workflow.

Once the setup agent has finished it will test your configuration and fix any errors if required.
