Using the setup Agent, Engine can attempt to automatically configure and test its development environment for your repo.

The setup agent will run automatically when a new repo is connected and can be re-run from the repositories VM settings page.

<Warning>
  The setup agent is still in beta. You may be required to edit Engine's task runner setup\!
</Warning>

This can take several minutes depending on the size and complexity of your repo and workflow.
