You can get [cto.new](http://cto.new) to work on your code by starting a task. The result of a task is usually a pull request. There are several ways to start a task:

<Icon icon="comment" size={20} /> Let [cto.new](http://cto.new) start a task from a chat

<Icon icon="stars" size={20} /> Enter a task description directly in the tasks page

<Icon icon="tag" size={20} /> Add a repo specific label to a ticket (find this on the repositories page)

<Icon icon="at" size={20} /> Tag @engine anywhere in an **issue** or **pull request**

<Icon icon="person-circle-plus" size={20} /> Assign an issue to engine (Linear only)

<Tip>
  Try the chat - it's the best way to plan and code with cto.new
