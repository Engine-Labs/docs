You can get [cto.new](http://cto.new) to work on your code by starting a task. The result of a task is usually a pull request. There are several ways to start a task:

<Icon icon="stars" size={20} /> Enter a task description directly in the tasks page

<Icon icon="tag" size={20} /> Add a repo specific label to a ticket (find this on the repositories page)

<Icon icon="comment" size={20} /> Tag @engine in a comment in your issues (Linear and Trello only)

<Icon icon="person-circle-plus" size={20} /> Assign an issue to engine (Linear only)

<Icon icon="comments-question-check" size={20} /> Tag @engine anywhere in a pull request
