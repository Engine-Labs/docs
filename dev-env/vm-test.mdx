Run a VM setup test to verify your VM is confured properly and Engine can successfuly make commits.

<Note>
  You VM setup won't be used by Engine unless it has been tested successfully
</Note>

Running a test can take several minutes but can be manually stopped.

If your pipeline changes or you make any changes to Engine's VM you must re-run the tests to ensure Engine can work effectively.

### VM Terminal

You can open a terminal on an instance of Engine's VM to test any command or series of commands.

This can be helpful in debugging Engine's VM configuration.

You can access the terminal from the VM setup page for a given repo.

<Warning>
  Any commands entered in the terminal will not persist to any other instances of Engine's VM.

  The system available in the terminal will always start with the default VM specification.
