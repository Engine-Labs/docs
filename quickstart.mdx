### 1. Create your team

Give your team a name.

<Note>
  You'll need to contact us if you want to change this later\!
</Note>

### 2. Link your git provider

Engine works with GitHub and GitLab. You can only link one git provider at a time.

You can allow access to all repos or only specific repos during the auth flow. If you want to update these permissions later navigate to the Engine Labs application in your git provider's settings.

The user must have sufficient permissions to create webhooks on the repos you want Engine to work on.

<Warning>
  It is strongly recommended that you add branch protection rules when allowing AI access to your codebase.
</Warning>

### 3. Link your issues board

Link Engine to Linear, Trello, Jira, or Clickup (more coming soon) in one click.

The user must have permissions to create webhooks on issues boards.

### 4. Link a repo

Select a repo you want Engine to work on from the 'link repository' menu.

Engine will automatically index the codebase and start running the VM set-up agent. The set-up agent identifies project dependencies and code check steps (linting, formatting, testing etc) and automatically configures Engine's cloud development VM.

This can take 2-30 minutes depending on the size and complexity of your repo.

<Note>
  You will only see repos that you have sufficient access for in the repo linking menu.
</Note>

### 5. Connect board to repo

### 6. Run your first task
