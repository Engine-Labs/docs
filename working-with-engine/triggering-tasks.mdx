Engine can be triggered in a number of ways:

<Icon icon="tag" size={20} /> Adding a label with the repo specific Engine tag (find this tag on Engine's repositories page)

<Icon icon="comment" size={20} /> Tagging @engine-labs in a comment in your issues (Linear and Trello only)

<Icon icon="face-monocle" size={20} /> Submitting a code review on an Engine PR

<Icon icon="comments-question-check" size={20} /> Tagging @engine-labs in a comment on any PR

<Icon icon="recycle" size={20} /> Retry a task from the Engine app

<Note>
  Removing and re-adding a label in a ticket will re-trigger Engine
