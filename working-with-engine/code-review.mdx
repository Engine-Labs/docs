Engine works directly inside your git providers app, creating, updating, and working on pull requests.

When Engine creates a PR, it will automatically write a useful title and description. Things such as branch and PR names can be configured from the git integration page in the Engine app.

After a PR is created, Engine can re-start work on its own PRs or help out on PRs from other users.

There are a number of ways to work with Engine from PRs in your git providers application. Some interactions depend on whether you are using [Github](/integrations/github) or [Gitlab](/integrations/gitlab) but the principles remain the same.

### Automatic Triggers

<Note>
  Automatic triggers will only work if your repo has a passing [VM setup](/dev-env/vm)
</Note>

If Engine is properly setup for your repo, it will automatically respond to a failing pipeline or automatic reviews and attempt to work on your PR until is in a passing state. Typically, Engine will try to do this three times.

You can ignore git users (such as bots) from the git menu in the Engine app.

### **Existing Tasks**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code review" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Review an Engine PR to have Engine pick it back up and make changes.

    You can make line-by-line comments or just leave a high level review. It's best to 'request changes' to make it clear you need Engine to re-start work.

  <Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
    Tag @engine-labs anywhere in the PR to get engine to restart work on a task.
