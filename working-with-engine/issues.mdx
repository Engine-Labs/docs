By tagging Engine in an issue using a label or tagging Engine in a comment @engine-labs (Linear and Trello only), you can trigger Engine to start work directly from your workflow tools.

<Check>
  Engine can ingest images from your issues
</Check>

Engine will ingest all context in an issue or ticket before starting work. This includes images and comments.

If you add context later, re-trigger the task to provide this information to Engine.

### **Starting a Task**

There are two ways to start a task:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tag Engine" icon="tag">
    Tag Engine in an issue and Engine will automatically start work. You can find repo specific labels on the repositories page in Engine. It will typically be engine-[your_repo_name].

    Engine will comment in the issue when it has finished working.

    To retrigger a task using tags, remove and re-add the tag.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="@engine-labs" icon="at">
    You can tag @engine-labs in an issue and Engine will pick it up or restart work if it's an existing task. This will include all updated information in the issue.

    This feature is only available on Linear and Trello.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### **Finishing a Task**

When Engine has finished working it will add the result as a comment in your issues.

If this has resulted in the successful creation of a pull request, engine will provide a link to it.

### Autopilot

Autopilot enables Engine to automatically pick up and attempt tickets and issues from your workflow tool once a day.

Autopilot is only available on select plans. You can enable autopilot from the workflow integration page in the Engine app.

Autopilot can be set to plan mode or task mode:

- **Plan mode** - Engine will automatically create a plan inside the ticket for your approval. Relabel the ticket with the Engine tag or tag @engine-labs in a comment to get Engine to start writing code.
- **Task mode** - Engine will automatically start work in a new branch on your repo. React to Engine's comment with a <Icon icon="thumbs-up" /> emoji and Engine will open a PR.

### Plan mode

Individual repos can be set to plan mode.

Plan mode adds a comment to the issue describing Engine's planned implementation and any clarifying questions.

To get Engine to start on implementation, relabel the issue with the Engine tag or tag @engine-labs in a comment.
